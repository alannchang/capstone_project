# V1 Known Code Issues

The following are known issues in the V1 codebase that should be considered when making changes.

## Critical Issues

1. **Python Integration Problems**
   - Python.h cannot be found (linter error in main.cpp)
   - Gmail API integration is incomplete and partially commented out

2. **Memory Management Issues**
   - Raw pointers and C-style memory allocation (strdup) in LlamaInference.cpp
   - Potential memory leaks in tool_manager.cpp and message handling

3. **Project Identity**
   - Project is named "MaiMail" in CMakeLists.txt but "InboxPilot" in README.md
   - Codebase contains both general chat functionality and Gmail-specific code

## UI Implementation

- UI layout uses hardcoded values that may not work well on all terminal sizes
- No progress indicators for model loading or other long operations
- Limited keyboard shortcut support

## Tool Management

- Tool execution framework exists but error handling is minimal
- Debug logging uses hardcoded file paths
- Tool parsing doesn't handle all LLM output formats
