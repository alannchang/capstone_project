## Overview

The goal of this open-source project is to develop a TUI-based AI-powered email manager that minimizes or eliminates the need for users to interact directly with their email inbox. By analyzing user behavior and email data, the program leverages machine learning techniques to predict user actions and prompt confirmations for handling incoming emails.

Key features include AI-generated email summaries, smart filtering based on user behavior, and automated email management. Over time, users can allow the program to handle emails autonomously without requiring confirmation.

This application acts as a live "assistant" or "manager," helping users save time by reducing the need to manually check their email inbox. Customization is a core principle, allowing users to enable/disable features and install plugins for a tailored experience. The program runs locally, prioritizing user privacy by avoiding cloud services and telemetry.

## Features

- AI-generated email summaries using a model of the user’s choice
- Advanced spam filtering based on user behavior
- Logs for tracking program actions and troubleshooting
- Customizable feature set with plugin support
- Lightweight, locally-running application with no cloud dependencies

## Project Scope

This project will be designed exclusively for Gmail accounts due to its extensive API support. The program aims to provide a seamless TUI-based experience, ensuring users never need to log into their gmail manually if the application functions as intended.

## Technical Implementation

Primary Languages: Python (for MCP implementation), C/C++ (for llama.cpp and TUI interface)
TUI Library: FTXUI
Concurrency: At least two threads—one for monitoring email activity and another for UI interaction
Minimal Dependencies: Keep external libraries to a minimum for a lightweight and user-friendly experience

## Development Goals

Implement an AI-driven approach to categorize and manage emails based on user preferences
Develop a responsive and efficient TUI for seamless user interaction
Ensure complete privacy by keeping all data local
Provide an extensible system with plugin support for enhanced functionality

This README serves as a blueprint for the development of the TUI-based AI-powered email manager/assistant.
