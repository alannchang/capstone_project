# Codebase Analysis

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to be a local-first, privacy-respecting email management application, leveraging local LLM inference and potentially other AI techniques. The primary components identified in the current codebase are a C++ application for LLM inference using `llama.cpp` and a Python-based microservice for Gmail API interaction.

## 2. Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`CMakeLists.txt`**: Main build configuration for the C++ application.
- **`inc/`**: Contains header files for the C++ application.
    - `LlamaInference.h`: Header for the LLM inference module.
- **`src/`**: Contains source code for the C++ application.
    - `LlamaInference.cpp`: Implementation of local LLM inference using `llama.cpp`.
    - `main.cpp`: Main entry point for the C++ application. Likely handles application flow and potentially a Terminal User Interface (TUI), though TUI-specific libraries beyond standard C++ includes were not immediately apparent in the directory listing.
- **`gmail-microservice/`**: Contains the Python-based Gmail interaction service.
    - `gmail_service.py`: Implements functionality to interact with the Gmail API (reading emails, sending, managing labels, etc.).
    - `pyproject.toml`: Python project configuration.
- **`.cursor/rules/`**: Contains markdown documents (referred to as "cursor rules") that appear to be a snapshot of the project's V1 design, issues, and plans.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation, currently outlines a broader vision including a TUI, Reinforcement Learning agent, and a more integrated system.

## 3. Key Components and Functionalities

### 3.1. C++ LLM Inference (`LlamaInference.cpp`, `LlamaInference.h`, `main.cpp`)

- **Core Functionality**: Provides the capability to load and run GGUF-format language models locally using the `llama.cpp` library.
- **`LlamaInference` Class**: Encapsulates model loading, context management, tokenization, and text generation.
- **`main.cpp`**: Likely orchestrates the use of `LlamaInference`, handles user input if a TUI is present, and manages the application's main loop. The extent of TUI implementation requires deeper inspection of `main.cpp`.

### 3.2. Python Gmail Microservice (`gmail-microservice/gmail_service.py`)

- **Core Functionality**: Interacts with the Gmail API via a FastAPI server to perform email-related operations.
- **Capabilities**:
    - Authenticating with Gmail (OAuth2).
    - Listing all messages (IDs and thread IDs) in the user's mailbox, with support for query filtering and pagination to retrieve all results (via `GET /messages`).
    - Fetching the full content (headers, body, payload, etc.) of a specific message by its ID (via `GET /messages/{message_id}`).
    - Sending emails.
    - Managing labels (creating, deleting, listing, getting, updating).
    - Modifying email states (trashing messages).
    - Retrieving user profile and history.
- **Communication**: The method of communication between the C++ application and this Python service is via HTTP requests to the FastAPI endpoints. The C++ application would act as a client to this service.

## 4. Dependencies

### 4.1. C++ Application:
    - `llama.cpp`: For local LLM inference.
    - `FTXUI` (mentioned in `README.md` and `.cursor/rules/v1-dependencies.mdc`): For building a terminal user interface. Its actual usage in `main.cpp` needs verification.
    - `nlohmann/json` (mentioned in `.cursor/rules/v1-dependencies.mdc`): For JSON parsing, possibly for LLM tool calls or configuration.

### 4.2. Python Gmail Microservice:
    - `google-api-python-client`: For Gmail API interaction.
    - `google-auth-oauthlib`: For OAuth2 authentication.
    - Other standard Python libraries as defined in `pyproject.toml`.

## 5. Current State vs. README Vision

The `README.md` describes a comprehensive system with:
- A TUI frontend (FTXUI).
- A Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for learning email actions.
- A Core App Controller in C++ orchestrating different modules.
- An LLM Engine for summaries and explanations.
- An MCP Server (Python) for Gmail API access.

Based on the visible codebase:
- The **LLM Engine** (via `LlamaInference.cpp`) is present.
- The **MCP Server** (Python Gmail microservice) is present.
- The **TUI frontend** implementation status is unclear without deeper inspection of `main.cpp` and its dependencies. The `README.md` and "cursor rules" mention FTXUI.
- The **RL Agent** and the **Core App Controller** (as a distinct orchestrating C++ entity separate from `main.cpp`) do not have immediately obvious corresponding files in the `src` or `inc` directories. These might be planned or part of `main.cpp` in a less modular form.

## 6. "Cursor Rules" (.cursor/rules/)

These files (`v1-code-issues.mdc`, `v1-architecture.mdc`, etc.) provide a valuable snapshot of the intended V1 architecture, known issues, dependencies, and future plans as of a certain point in development. They will need to be updated to reflect the current codebase accurately. For example, `v1-architecture.mdc` mentions `tool_manager.cpp` and `python_bindings.cpp` which were not visible in the primary `src` listing.

## 7. Potential Areas for Improvement / Further Development / Analysis

- **Integration between C++ and Python**: The C++ application will communicate with the Python Gmail microservice via HTTP requests to its FastAPI endpoints.
- **TUI Implementation**: Verify the extent and functionality of the TUI.
- **RL Agent and Core Controller**: Determine if these components exist in some form or are purely planned features. If planned, the `README.md` should clearly state this.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Assess and improve error handling and logging across both C++ and Python components.
- **Build System**: Ensure `CMakeLists.txt` and `pyproject.toml` are up-to-date with all dependencies and build steps.
- **Code Comments and Documentation**: Improve inline code comments and ensure external documentation (like `README.md`) is current.
- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for key functionalities.
- **Cursor Rules Update**: Revise the `.cursor/rules/` documents to match the current state.
- **Security**: Review security aspects, especially concerning Gmail API credentials and local data storage.

## 8. Summary of Codebase Capabilities

Currently, the codebase demonstrably supports:
- **Local LLM inference**: Loading models and generating text via the C++ application.
- **Comprehensive Gmail API interaction**: Listing messages (all results with pagination), getting full message content, sending messages, managing labels, and more, via the Python FastAPI microservice.

The integration of these two core capabilities into a cohesive application, along with the status of the TUI and other planned features like RL, requires further code inspection or clarification on the C++ client-side implementation for the FastAPI service.
